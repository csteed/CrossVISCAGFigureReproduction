This script is to accompany our submission of the CAG preprint paper entitled "CrossVis: A Visual Analytics System for Exploring Heterogeneous Multivariate Data with Applications to Materials and Climate Sciences" for Graphics Replicability Stamp Initiative (GRSI) verification. Follow the steps below to reproduce Figure 1 from our paper. This figure exercises most of the novel features of the CrossVis system and it shows a data set that is used as a case study in our paper.

We provide instructions below on downloading and installing a precompiled version of CrossVis for the Mac operating system. A movie is also provided showing download and install using the CrossVis installer.

Because CrossVis is an interactive data analysis tool, we show the steps for running the program, loading data, and configuring the view to match Figure 1 in a movie.

To reproduce Figure 1 from the CAG paper follow the following steps:

1.) Clone this repository containing the this script, the CrossVis paper
preprint, sample data, and the instructive video. The repository is located at https://github.com/csteed/CrossVISCAGFigureReproduction.git.

2.) Watch the video 'CrossVisInstallProcess.mp4' from this repository to see the steps for downloading and installing the precompiled version of CrossVis from the CrossVis Github repository release section:
https://github.com/ORNL/CrossVis/releases/download/v2.1.6/CrossVis-2.1.6.pkg

Manual compilation for CrossVis is not necessary if the precompiled release mentioned above is used. However, if you wish to manually compile CrossVis, follow the instructions in the README.md on the CrossVis Github source code repository: [https://github.com/ORNL/CrossVis](https://github.com/ORNL/CrossVis). Following these instructions, the jar files can be built and CrossVis can be executed using provided scripts.

Verified commands for building CrossVis (combining the steps mentioned above) are listed below:

  brew install maven java (this assumes homebrew is installed on a Mac platform)
  brew install maven java
  sudo ln -sfn /usr/local/opt/openjdk/libexec/openjdk.jdk /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/openjdk.jdk
  git submodule update --init --depth 1
  cd CrossVis
  mvn clean
  mvn compile
  mvn package (errors will occur from java packager but these can be ignored)
  cd scripts
  cp ../target/crossvis-2.1.6-jar-with-dependencies.jar .
  curl -o javafx.zip -L https://gluonhq.com/download/javafx-11-0-2-sdk-mac
unzip javafx.zip
  java -Xmx6g --module-path javafx-sdk-11.0.2/lib --add-modules javafx.controls -cp ./crossvis-2.1.6-jar-with-dependencies.jar gov.ornl.crossvis.CrossVis

3.) After installing CrossVis, follow the steps shown in the instructive video 'CAGFigure1Reproduce.mp4' to produce a view like the one shown in Figure 1 of the paper.
