This script is to accompany our submission of the CAG preprint paper entitled "CrossVis: A Visual Analytics System for Exploring Heterogeneous Multivariate Data with Applications to Materials and Climate Sciences" for Graphics Replicability Stamp Initiative (GRSI) verification. Follow the steps below to reproduce Figure 1 from our paper. This figure exercises most of the novel features of the CrossVis system and it shows a data set that is used as a case study in our paper.

We provide instructions below on downloading and installing a precompiled version of CrossVis for the Mac operating system. A movie is also provided showing download and install using the CrossVis installer.

Because CrossVis is an interactive data analysis tool, we show the steps for running the program, loading data, and configuring the view to match Figure 1 in a movie.

To reproduce Figure 1 from the CAG paper follow the following steps:

1.) Clone this repository containing the this script, the CrossVis paper
preprint, sample data, and the instructive video. The repository is located at https://github.com/csteed/CrossVISCAGFigureReproduction.git.

2.) Watch the video 'CrossVisInstallProcess.mp4' from this repository to see the steps for downloading and installing the precompiled version of CrossVis from the CrossVis Github repository release section:
https://github.com/ORNL/CrossVis/releases/download/v2.1.6/CrossVis-2.1.6.pkg

(Note: The main github repository for the CrossVis source code is at https://github.com/ORNL/CrossVis)

3.) After installing CrossVis, follow the steps shown in the instructive video 'CAGFigure1Reproduce.mp4' to produce a view like
the one shown in Figure 1 of the paper.
